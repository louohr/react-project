# Book Collection

Final project for Lexicon frontend with React and TypeScript.

## Description

This is a book collection website application where users can add new books to their collection and view them in a book list. They can also edit books and remove them from the list if they want.

I have used two APIs. One for books and one to generate a random book quote.
